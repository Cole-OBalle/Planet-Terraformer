About the Game:
Humanity is moving to the stars, but it seems habitable planets are hard to come by. However, this is no worry to you, so maginficant Planet Terraformer.
You control your trusty Starship, USSS Transformation, which, for the meanwhile will be orbiting around humanity's next homeland. 
Manueverability is no issue. Moving left to right is just as easy as using A and D on a keyboard (it might even be the controls themselves)
Utilize your McAsteroidDestroyerAD2(tm) cannon the blast those stones to smaller chunks, ideal for building your planet's mass.
Becareful! Letting these massive space chunks hit your planet head on will only diminish your mass, so make sure you destroy as many as you can!
Some asteroids are bigger than others, and require multiple hits! 
The bigger your planet, the faster those asteroids fall!

Eventually, you'll find yourself satisfied with the mass you have so effortlessly collected. 
Do not forget, that Water is vital for life on a planet. You should soon see water-filled comets fly buy, shoot those down and hydrate your planet!
Around this time, asteroids shouldn't be appearing as common, and larger ones are practically obsolete. Your planet is now sizely enough to not be effected by asteroids.
However, asteroid collisions as still dangerous, for they can evaporate your hard-earned H2O. Do not take your eye off them!
Interestingly it seems that asteroids, for whatever reason, fall SLOWER than before, at this stage. I wonder if there is a God out there finally showing humanity some mercy, 
like a game developer trying to his game not-so impossible. Hah, imagine that!
